## Dataset Extraction

This directry contains the code to create our datasets (or similar ones) 
based on the routes extracted with PARoutes (see [`scripts/paroutes`](../paroutes/README.md)).

1. Collect the training routes.
2. Optional: extract test subsets.
3. Extract the reactions for single-step experiments.
